2. Optimize Shipping Modes:
- Continue prioritizing Standard Class shipping while exploring opportunities to boost Same Day shipping sales through incentives or promotions.
3. Expand in High-Performing Regions:
- Invest in the West Region with targeted campaigns, given its sales dominance.
- Analyze and address challenges in underperforming states.
4. Increase Segment Engagement:
- Create tailored offers for the Consumer Segment, given its significant contribution.
- Encourage increased spending from the Home Office segment with discounts or loyalty programs.
5. Seasonal Strategy:
Utilize sales trends to prepare for peak months, ensuring adequate stock and marketing during high-demand periods.

### TO ANALYZE CHALLENGES

To analyze challenges in underperforming states:

1. **Compare Sales Data**: Check how sales in low-performing states differ from high-performing ones.
2. **Evaluate Customers**: See which customer groups are contributing less.
3. **Review Marketing**: Assess if advertising and promotions are effective in those regions.
4. **Check Shipping**: Look for delivery issues that might discourage buyers.
5. **Consider Local Factors**: Explore economic conditions or competition affecting sales.
6. **Get Feedback**: Gather input from customers in those states to identify their needs or issues.
